This is a repro case for [flatbuffers/issues/7354](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/issues/7354)

# Instructions

Use full paths when calling the flatc executable. On Windows, the project is
going to be cloned into `C:/Users/Alexa/Programming/`.

```
cd C:/Users/Alexa/Programming/
git clone https://github.com/alexames/issue7354
cd issue7354
flatc.exe -o C:/Users/Alexa/Programming/issue7354/generated/foo `
          -I C:/Users/Alexa/Programming/issue7354 `
          -c C:/Users/Alexa/Programming/issue7354/foo/Bar.fbs `
          --include-prefix generated `
          --keep-prefix
```

The resulting file, 
`C:/Users/Alexa/Programming/issue7354/generated/foo/Bar_generated.h` should look
like this:

```
// automatically generated by the FlatBuffers compiler, do not modify


#ifndef FLATBUFFERS_GENERATED_BAR_H_
#define FLATBUFFERS_GENERATED_BAR_H_

#include "flatbuffers/flatbuffers.h"

// Ensure the included flatbuffers.h is the same version as when this file was
// generated, otherwise it may not be compatible.
static_assert(FLATBUFFERS_VERSION_MAJOR == 2 &&
              FLATBUFFERS_VERSION_MINOR == 0 &&
              FLATBUFFERS_VERSION_REVISION == 6,
             "Non-compatible flatbuffers version included");

#include "generated/C:/Users/Alexa/Programming/issue7354/Baz_generated.h"

#endif  // FLATBUFFERS_GENERATED_BAR_H_
```
 
Once again use full paths when calling the flatc executable. On Linux, the
project is going to be cloned into `~/src/`.

```
cd ~/src/
git clone https://github.com/alexames/issue7354
cd issue7354
flatc -o ~/src/issue7354/generated/foo \
      -I ~/src/issue7354 \
      -c ~/src/issue7354/foo/Bar.fbs \
      --include-prefix generated \
      --keep-prefix
```

The resulting file, `~/src/issue7354/generated/foo/Bar_generated.h` should look
like this:

```
// automatically generated by the FlatBuffers compiler, do not modify


#ifndef FLATBUFFERS_GENERATED_BAR_H_
#define FLATBUFFERS_GENERATED_BAR_H_

#include "flatbuffers/flatbuffers.h"

// Ensure the included flatbuffers.h is the same version as when this file was
// generated, otherwise it may not be compatible.
static_assert(FLATBUFFERS_VERSION_MAJOR == 2 &&
              FLATBUFFERS_VERSION_MINOR == 0 &&
              FLATBUFFERS_VERSION_REVISION == 6,
             "Non-compatible flatbuffers version included");

#include "generated//home/alex/src/issue7354/Baz_generated.h"

#endif  // FLATBUFFERS_GENERATED_BAR_H_
```

Notice that in both cases, the `#include` path has the root after `generated/`.
On windows that means it starts with `C:/`, and on Linux it starts with an
additional slash. These `#include`s should be:

```
#include "C:/Users/Alexa/Programming/issue7354/generated/Baz_generated.h"
```
and
``` 
#include "/home/alex/src/issue7354/generated/Baz_generated.h"
```
