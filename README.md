This is a repro case for [flatbuffers/issues/7354](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/issues/7354)

# Instructions

Use full paths when calling the flatc executable. On Windows, the project is
going to be cloned into `C:/Users/Alexa/Programming/`.

```
cd C:/Users/Alexa/Programming/
git clone https://github.com/alexames/issue7354
cd issue7354
flatc.exe -o C:/Users/Alexa/Programming/issue7354/build/generated `
          -I C:/Users/Alexa/Programming/issue7354 `
          -c C:/Users/Alexa/Programming/issue7354/foo/Bar.fbs `
          --include-prefix generated `
          --keep-prefix
```

The output should look like this:

```
// automatically generated by the FlatBuffers compiler, do not modify


#ifndef FLATBUFFERS_GENERATED_BAR_H_
#define FLATBUFFERS_GENERATED_BAR_H_

#include "flatbuffers/flatbuffers.h"

// Ensure the included flatbuffers.h is the same version as when this file was
// generated, otherwise it may not be compatible.
static_assert(FLATBUFFERS_VERSION_MAJOR == 2 &&
              FLATBUFFERS_VERSION_MINOR == 0 &&
              FLATBUFFERS_VERSION_REVISION == 6,
             "Non-compatible flatbuffers version included");

#include "generated/C:/Users/Alexa/Programming/issue7354/Baz_generated.h"

#endif  // FLATBUFFERS_GENERATED_BAR_H_
```
